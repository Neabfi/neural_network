neural_network documentation
==========================================

First you need to include the module:

`from neural_network import *`

To create a new neural network, you need to instantiate the Net class.

`net = Net([2, 3, 2])`

net will be a neural network with 3 layers.
2 neurons on its input layer, 3 neurons on its hidden layer and 2 neurons on its outputs layer.
You can create as many layer you want.
